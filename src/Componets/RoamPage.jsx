        People donâ€™t engage with their local areas as much as they used to. In our cities and towns, there are hundreds of hidden landmarks, buildings and monuments that enrich the cultural canvas of our communities.
I had the pleasure of working with an amazing team of junior developers on Roam, a unique maps app designed to tackle this problem by implementing game-like features to encourage users to explore and interact with their local area.

                <li>Front end development for Roam was acheived using React Native and Expo.</li>
                <li>Libraries such as React Native Paper allowed us to create a polished and consistent user interface.</li>
                <li>The Expo Camera and Expo Location libraries were instrumental in developing many functions of the app.</li>
                <li>The map screen presented the biggest challenge on the project and was built using React Native Maps and the google API, using polygon components to hide and reveal areas of the map dynamically.</li>
